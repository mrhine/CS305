Artemis Financial is a financial organization looking for secure communications. They currently have a RESTful web application programming interface (API) and are looking to enhance the security of operations. To a company like Artemis Financial protecting their client information is paramount. Failure to do so could lead to significant financial losses for clients and the company, potentially resulting in litigation, regulatory penalties, and a loss of customer trust. Software security is an integral aspect of the entire software development lifecycle. Secure coding practices are crucial for protecting both the company and user data from malicious or accidental misuse. A significant vulnerability identified in Artemis Financial's application was the presence of outdated dependencies with known security flaws. As vulnerabilities are continuously discovered and more easily exploited, maintaining up-to-date dependencies is essential. A key contribution to enhancing the application's security was identifying and updating these outdated dependencies. The vulnerability assessment process highlighted opportunities to strengthen various security aspects. For me a major challenge encountered was with the development environment, which presented numerous technical issues unrelated to the applications code or security functionality. This involved extensive troubleshooting, including adjusting IDE properties, Java versions, proxy settings, and the keystore file. Despite significant time spent with no progress, the issues resolved themselves unexpectedly the following day without any further configuration changes.
To improve security, several measures were implemented: enabling HTTPS for encrypted communication, utilizing the OWASP Dependency Check for continuous monitoring and updating of libraries and dependencies, and integrating a checksum generator to verify the recipient's authenticity before exchanging sensitive information. Ongoing security enhancements should include manual code reviews, static application security testing, and penetration testing. To verify the effectiveness of implemented measures, the OWASP Dependency Check was rerun to compare results and check for new vulnerabilities. Manual code reviews focused on identifying potential vulnerabilities such as direct injection of user input into the database and unencrypted communication channels.
Learning to generate self-signed certificates and utilize the OWASP Dependency Check were valuable and practical skills gained during this process. Furthermore, the manual code review and static testing provided insightful perspectives on security best practices. Developing the SHA-256 checksum integration was a particularly valuable experience and a skill I am eager to showcase with future employers. I look forward to continuing to grow in my knowledge of software security and intend to stay informed about the latest research and best practices in the field.
